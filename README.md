# MAT 8480 Data Mining & Predictive Analytics Group Project
This repository contains the R code we used to build predictive models for a travel company, with the target variable being whether or not the customer rebooked with this travel company within 12 months of their trip. The raw data has not been posted for privacy reasons, but this shows our process for the types of models we explored. 

We compared decision trees, logistic regression models, aritificial neural networks and random forests to find the best way to model these data. Through this process, the "best" method appeared to be the random forest.
